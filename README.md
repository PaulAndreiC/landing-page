Landing Page - TOP project

This is the last project of the HTML & CSS part of the Foundations course.
Basically this is a landing page, as the title implies, created based on two images, provided by the course:
one image presents the overlook of the page, while the other one specifies the family-font, font-weight, font-size and font-color, for different sections of the page.
